        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="para">The Famous Five is a series of children's adventure novels and short stories written by English author Enid Blyton. The first book, Five on a Treasure Island, was published in 1942. The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children – Julian, Dick, Anne and Georgina (George) – and their dog Timmy.Julian is intelligent as well as caring, responsible and kind. His cleverness and reliability are often noted by Aunt Fanny and George. He deals with the more "grown-up" things and looks out for his siblings and cousin in their adventures.George Kirrin (full name Georgina) is A tomboy. She owns Timmy, the loyal dog who is one of the Five. She detests being called by her full name or being seen as a girl, and has a fiery temper.Dick Kirrin is one of the Famous Five, the brother of Julian and Anne, and cousin of George. He has a cheeky sense of humour, but is also dependable and kind in nature. He is the same age as his cousin George, and the middle child of his siblings. Unlike her cousin George, Anne generally acts more girly and takes care of the domestic duties during the Five's various camping holidays. As the youngest, she is more likely than the others to be frightened, and does not enjoy the adventures as much as the others. Timmy is loving, loyal and intelligent. He is usually friendly, but will attack in order to protect the Famous Five if they are in danger. He understands George well and does whatever she tells him to.
